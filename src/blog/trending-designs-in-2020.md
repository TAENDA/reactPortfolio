### Trending designs in 2023.

Design trends can evolve rapidly, and what's considered "trending" can vary based on the industry, region, and individual preferences. As of my last knowledge update in January 2023, here are some design trends that were gaining momentum and might continue to be relevant in 2023:

Neomorphism and Soft UI: Neomorphism is a design style that involves creating soft, realistic, and three-dimensional elements in user interfaces. It focuses on buttons, cards, and other UI elements appearing to extrude from the background, providing a tactile and inviting feel.

Sustainability and Eco-Friendly Design: As environmental concerns continue to grow, design that emphasizes sustainability and eco-friendliness is becoming more prevalent. This includes the use of earthy colors, eco-friendly product packaging, and the promotion of sustainable practices in design.

Abstract and Artistic Illustrations: Illustrations and graphics that are abstract, artistic, and often hand-drawn are becoming popular for branding and web design. They can add a unique and personalized touch to a brand's identity.

Dark Mode and Low-Light Design: Dark mode, which uses darker color schemes, is now a standard feature in many applications. Designers are embracing dark mode and low-light design to reduce eye strain and enhance the visual appeal of interfaces.

Immersive 3D and AR/VR Experiences: With the growing popularity of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), designers are focusing on creating immersive 3D experiences. This trend is particularly relevant for gaming, e-commerce, and educational applications.

Minimalist and Simplified Design: Minimalism is a timeless trend that continues to gain momentum. Designers are embracing clean, simple, and uncluttered user interfaces, with a focus on clarity and usability.

Retro and Nostalgic Design: Nostalgia-driven design, which evokes the look and feel of past eras, is making a comeback. This can include vintage color palettes, typography, and retro-inspired visuals.

Serif Typography: While sans-serif fonts have dominated digital design for some time, serif fonts are making a resurgence. They add a touch of elegance and timelessness to websites and applications.
