<h3>Installing NodeJS on your device.</h3>
<p>
To install Node.js on your device, you'll need to follow these steps. Node.js is available for various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Here, I'll provide general instructions, but you should choose the appropriate method for your specific OS.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Visit the Node.js official website at https://nodejs.org/ and go to the "Downloads" section.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You'll see two versions: LTS (Long Term Support) and Current. It's recommended to choose the LTS version for stability. Click the "LTS" version to download it.

Run the downloaded installer and follow the installation instructions. You can accept the default settings in most cases.

After installation, open your command prompt or PowerShell and type node -v to check if Node.js is installed. It should display the version number.

Similarly, type npm -v to check the version of npm (Node Package Manager).</p>
